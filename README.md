This is the word game - piggy!

How to play:

1. The computer generates a target word of size k.

2. The computer then asks for an input of a k sized letter word.

3. For every letter that is in your input word and in the target word AND in the correct spot, you get a "piggy".

4. For every letter that is in your input word and in the target word BUT NOT in the correct spot, you get an "oink".

5. If you get k piggy's, that means you guessed the word and you win!

PIGGY

After 5 attempts, if you still have not guessed the word, then an image hint will be generated based on the target word.

After 10 attempts, you lose and the answer is revealed.
